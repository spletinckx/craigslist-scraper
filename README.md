# craigslist-scraper
Finding housing in Santa Barbara is a pain at the moment. Scrolling Craigslist endlessly might cause fatigue in identifying good potential houses.
This scraper goes over Craigslist for you and provides a list of potential houses. The scraper is tweaked for my own needs, but the code should be straightforward enough for you to adjust it towards your personal search.

## Recommended Strategy
I would recommend to check Craigslist daily for any new houses that pop up.
Then, every few days, run the scraper to provide a big list of potential houses that you can go through when you have the time for it.
This helps in case some houses slipped by unnoticed, but also to get an overview of how the market might change over time (since you will encounter old listings this way).
